# ComfyUI-extra-nodes---quality-of-life
extra nodes to be used in comfyUI

# ComfyUI:
ComfyUI is an advanced node based UI utilizing Stable Diffusion. It allows you to create customized workflows such as image post-processing, or conversions.

# How to install:

Download the zip file.

Extract to ..\ComfyUI\custom_nodes

restart comfy if it was running (reload web, not enough)

you will find my nodes under new group O/…

# Current Nodes:
## LatentUpscaleMultiply:
it is a variant from the original LatentUpscale tool but instead of using width and height you use a multiply number
for example, if the original images dimensions are (512,512) and the mul values were (2,2) the result image will be (1024,1024)
also you can use it to downscale if needed by using fractions ex:(512,512) mul (.5,.5) → (256,256)
Node Path: O/Latent/LatentUpscaleMultiply

thanks for reading my message, I hope that my tools will help you.
